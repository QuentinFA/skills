# Decisions — session-outputs

Small ADRs: one per issue raised against this mod and settled. Before acting on an issue with the
mod, check here — if it has come up before, the answer and its reasoning are below. Add an entry
whenever an issue is settled, including when the answer is "leave it as is". Supersede rather than
delete.

## A mod, not a status line or a skill

*2026-10-08 · accepted*

**Issue:** seeing what a session produced — branches, line counts, issues and PRs opened — across
work that spans several repositories.

**Decision:** a mod that records from tool calls as they happen and draws a pane, with a one-line
status entry beside it.

**Rejected:** a status-line script — its input describes the current directory's repo only, so
multi-repo work is invisible. A skill — it would have to reconstruct the session after the fact
from the transcript, spending model turns on what event hooks see for free.

## Group by directory, and record what was used as well as produced

*2026-10-08 · accepted*

**Issue:** a list of edits alone does not say what a session *did*: the commands it ran and the
files it read are half the picture, and they mean little without where they happened.

**Decision:** one group per git root, or per directory outside any repo, holding its commands,
reads, edits, branches, commits and pushes. Paths are resolved through symbolic links before
grouping, since git reports roots that way (`/tmp` is `/private/tmp` on macOS).

**Rejected:** one flat timeline — it buries the per-repo answer the pane exists for.

## Line counts come from the session's own edits

*2026-10-08 · accepted*

**Issue:** counting lines changed when other sessions may be working in the same worktree.

**Decision:** count from what each tool call reports: Edit and Write patches, the engine's per-file
diff on Bash results, and each commit's own `numstat`. When a Bash command carries no diff — the
engine does not always attach one — compare the repo's `git diff --numstat HEAD` and untracked
files before and after the command.

**Rejected:** diffing each repo against the HEAD it had when the session first touched it — it
catches everything, but counts another session's work in a shared worktree as this one's.

**Consequences:** the before/after comparison costs three git calls before each Bash command,
capped at two seconds. A file already changed in the session gets approximate counts, a change
another session makes *during* the command is counted, and a command that edits and commits at
once has its commit recorded but not its edits. Outside a repo, only the engine's diff is seen.

## Command text backs up the engine's git and GitHub reports

*2026-10-08 · accepted*

**Issue:** a hook that rewrites command output (to save tokens, say) changed `git commit`'s output
to a one-line summary. The engine's structured report of the commit went missing, and with it the
commit; `gh` output lost its URLs the same way.

**Decision:** the engine's `gitOperation` stays the first source. Behind it: a `git commit` command
that moved HEAD records the new HEAD; branches, deletions and worktrees are read from the command
text; and a PR or issue URL missing from the output is rebuilt from the repo's GitHub remote and the
number. A `gh` write whose command exited with an error is still recorded, marked as such —
`gh pr close --delete-branch` can close the PR and then fail on the local branch switch.

**Rejected:** parsing command output — it is exactly what the rewriting hook changes.

## How a command's directory is read

*2026-10-08 · accepted*

**Issue:** commands were filed under the wrong directory: `cd /a && git -C b …` went to the session's
directory instead of `/a/b`, a trailing `cd ..` was resolved against the session's directory, and a
heredoc's body was parsed as if its `cd`, `git` and `gh` lines ran.

**Decision:** heredoc bodies are removed before any parsing; `cd`s are followed in order, each from
the last; a `git -C` is resolved from the `cd`s before it; `~` expands to the home directory.

**Rejected:** asking the shell — the mod sees the command before and after it runs, not the shell's
state, and running it again is not an option.

## Branch switches are not edits

*2026-10-08 · accepted*

**Issue:** `checkout`, `switch`, `pull`, `merge`, `rebase`, `stash` and `worktree` rewrite the working
tree without the session writing anything.

**Decision:** their working-tree changes are not counted as edits.

**Rejected:** counting them — a branch switch would show as hundreds of lines the session never
wrote.

## Deleted branches are followed

*2026-10-08 · accepted*

**Issue:** a branch created and then deleted still read as created, and deleting a branch the
session did not create left no trace — though a deletion is as much an output as a creation.

**Decision:** `git branch -d/-D/--delete` and `git push --delete` / `push <remote> :name` are
recorded. A deleted branch the session created is struck through in place; others are listed under
*deleted* and *deleted on remote*.

## Collapsed by default, outputs first

*2026-10-08 · accepted*

**Issue:** fully expanded, the pane overflowed its height and pushed the GitHub section — the outputs
that matter most — out of view.

**Decision:** GitHub, services and scheduled work come first; each directory collapses to one summary
line; directories where only commands ran come last, dimmed. **Expand all / Collapse all** and
**Copy all** sit at the top; the copy is the full record as markdown, with multi-line commands
shortened to their first line.

## Recording never affects the tool call

*2026-10-08 · accepted*

**Issue:** the mod runs git and reads state around every tool call; a failure there must not fail the
call it is observing.

**Decision:** each recorder is caught inside its hook, and each hook is registered with a `.catch`
that replays the call's result. A failed recording loses that entry, never the tool call.
